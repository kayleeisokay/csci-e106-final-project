Executive Summary

This section will describe the model usage, your conclusions and any regulatory and internal requirements. In a real world scneario, this section is for senior management who do not need to know the details. They need to know high level (the purpose of the model, limitations of the model and any issues).


\newpage
## I. Introduction (5 points)

*This section needs to introduce the reader to the problem to be resolved, the purpose, and the scope of the statistical testing applied. What you are doing with your prediction? What is the purpose of the model? What methods were trained on the data, how large is the test sample, and how did you build the model?*

In this project, our goal is to build a statistical model that can predict house sales prices in Kings county, USA based on house sales data collected in that area between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset contains information on 21613 houses, including the sale price, number of rooms, square footage, year built and renovated, view, and condition of the property. The house sale price was used as the outcome variable and all other variables were considered as independent variables. 70% of the dataset was used as training set and 30% was used as testing set. 

Using this framework, we built several different models using linear regression, logistic regression, regression tree, and neural network. When building each model, feature selection methods were used and the appropriate diagnostic tests were applied to verify that model assumptions were met. <TO DO: Can elaborate more on each model>

Finally, the performance of each models was evaluated by its accuracy in predicting house prices in the test set, specifically by examining the MSE of predicted values. Based on that, we propose that the best predictive model is _____. This model indicated that the most important factors that influence house prices in King County, USA are ______.

## II. Description of the data and quality (15 points)

*Here you need to review your data, the statistical test applied to understand the predictors and the response and how are they correlated. Extensive graph analysis is recommended. Is the data continuous, or categorical, do any transformation needed? Do you need dummies? *

## III. Model Development Process (15 points)

*Build a regression model to predict price.  And of course,  create the train data set which contains 70% of the data and use set.seed (1023). The remaining 30% will be your test data set. Investigate the data and combine the level of categorical variables if needed and drop variables. For example, you can drop id, Latitude, Longitude, etc. *

```{r section3a}
set.seed(1023)

response <- "price"

#Dropping variables as specified
drop.vars <- c("id", "lat", "long")
kc.house.df <- dplyr::select(HouseSales, -drop.vars) 

#Renaming to conform to unified convention
kc.house.df <- kc.house.df %>% rename("year_built" = "yr_built")
```


```{r section3b}
#Feature Ideas
#Quality Adjusted Features
transform_sqft_adj_grade <- function(kc.house.df){
  
  sqft_adj_grade <- kc.house.df[, "sqft_living"] / kc.house.df[, "grade"]
  
  return (sqft_adj_grade)
}

transform_sqft_adj_condition <- function(kc.house.df){
  
  sqft_adj_condition <- kc.house.df[, "sqft_living"] / kc.house.df[, "condition"]
  
  return (sqft_adj_condition)
}

transform_sqft_adj_waterfront <- function(kc.house.df){
  
  sqft_adj_waterfront <- kc.house.df[, "sqft_living"] * kc.house.df[, "waterfront"]
  
  return (sqft_adj_waterfront)
}
```

```{r section3c}
#Apply transformations 

kc.house.df$sqft_adj_grade <- transform_sqft_adj_grade(kc.house.df)
kc.house.df$sqft_adj_condition <- transform_sqft_adj_condition(kc.house.df)
kc.house.df$sqft_adj_waterfront<- transform_sqft_adj_waterfront(kc.house.df)

#Remove collinear variables
# sqft_basement + sqft_above = sqft_living
kc.house.df$sqft_basement <- NULL
```

```{r section3d}
set.seed(1023)

#use 70% of dataset as training set and 30% as test set
train_prop <- 0.7

index <- sample(1:nrow(HouseSales), size = round(train_prop * nrow(kc.house.df)))
kc.house.train.X <- kc.house.df[index, -which(names(kc.house.df) %in% c(response))] # modified slightly 
kc.house.train.y <- kc.house.df [index, response]

kc.house.test.X <- kc.house.df [-index, -which(names(kc.house.df) %in% c(response))]
kc.house.test.y <- kc.house.df [-index, response]
```

```{r}
#baseline model
baseline.model <- lm(price ~ . , data = cbind(price = kc.house.train.y, kc.house.train.X))
summary(baseline.model)
```


\newpage
## IV. Model Performance Testing (15 points)

*Use the test data set to assess the model performances. Here, build the best multiple linear models by using the stepwise both ways selection method. Compare the performance of the best two linear models. Make sure that model assumption(s) are checked for the final linear model. Apply remedy measures (transformation, etc.) that helps satisfy the assumptions. In particular you must deeply investigate unequal variances and multicollinearity. If necessary, apply remedial methods (WLS, Ridge, Elastic Net, Lasso, etc.). *

#TODO
1. Stepwise feature selection
2. Add plots (e.g. scale location, residual vs fitted)
3. Normality plots

TODO: The following code needs to be updated once we have the updated models from stepwise feature selection.
```{r}
#evaluate on test data

CalcTestMetrics <- function(pred, act, n, p) {
  SST <- var(act)*(length(act)-1)
  SSE <- sum((act-pred)^2)
  SSR <- sum(pred - mean(act))^2
  rsquared <- 1- SSE/SST
  
  adj.rsquared <- 1 - (((1 - rsquared)*(n-1)) / (n-p-1))
  mse <- sum((act - pred)^2) / (n-p)
  mae <- (sum(abs(act-pred))) / n
  
  return (
    list(
      adj.rsquared = adj.rsquared,
      rsquared = rsquared,
      mse = mse,
      mae = mae
    )
  )
}

pred <- predict(baseline.model, kc.house.test.X)
act <- kc.house.test.y
n <- dim(model.matrix(baseline.model)[, -1])[1]
p <- dim(model.matrix(baseline.model)[, -1])[2]

cbind(CalcTestMetrics(pred, act, n, p))
```


\newpage
## V. Challenger Models (15 points)

*Build an alternative model based on one of the following approaches to predict price: regression tree, NN, or SVM. Explore using a logistic regression. Check the applicable model assumptions. Apply in-sample and out-of-sample testing, backtesting and review the comparative goodness of fit of the candidate models. Describe step by step your procedure to get to the best model and why you believe it is fit for purpose.*

## VI. Model Limitation and Assumptions (15 points)

*Based on the performances on both train and test data sets, determine your primary (champion) model and the other model which would be your benchmark model. Validate your models using the test sample. Do the residuals look normal? Does it matter given your technique? How is the prediction performance using Pseudo R^2, SSE, RMSE?  Benchmark the model against alternatives. How good is the relative fit? Are there any serious violations of the model assumptions? Has the model had issues or limitations that the user must know? (Which assumptions are needed to support the Champion model?)* 


\newpage
## VII. Ongoing Model Monitoring Plan (5 points)

*How would you picture the model needing to be monitored, which quantitative thresholds and triggers would you set to decide when the model needs to be replaced? What are the assumptions that the model must comply with for its continuous use?*


\newpage
## VIII. Conclusion (5 points)

*Summarize your results here. What is the best model for the data and why?*
