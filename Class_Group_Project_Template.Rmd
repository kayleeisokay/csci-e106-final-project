Executive Summary

This section will describe the model usage, your conclusions and any regulatory and internal requirements. In a real world scneario, this section is for senior management who do not need to know the details. They need to know high level (the purpose of the model, limitations of the model and any issues).


\newpage
## I. Introduction (5 points)

*This section needs to introduce the reader to the problem to be resolved, the purpose, and the scope of the statistical testing applied. What you are doing with your prediction? What is the purpose of the model? What methods were trained on the data, how large is the test sample, and how did you build the model?*

In this project, our goal is to build a statistical model that can predict house sales prices in Kings county, USA based on house sales data collected in that area between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset contains information on 21613 houses, including the sale price, number of rooms, square footage, year built and renovated, view, and condition of the property. The house sale price was used as the outcome variable and all other variables were considered as independent variables. 70% of the dataset was used as training set and 30% was used as testing set. 

Using this framework, we built several different models using linear regression, logistic regression, regression tree, and neural network. When building each model, feature selection methods were used and the appropriate diagnostic tests were applied to verify that model assumptions were met. <TO DO: Can elaborate more on each model>

Finally, the performance of each models was evaluated by its accuracy in predicting house prices in the test set, specifically by examining the MSE of predicted values. Based on that, we propose that the best predictive model is _____. This model indicated that the most important factors that influence house prices in King County, USA are ______.

## II. Description of the data and quality (15 points)

*Here you need to review your data, the statistical test applied to understand the predictors and the response and how are they correlated. Extensive graph analysis is recommended. Is the data continuous, or categorical, do any transformation needed? Do you need dummies? *

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
```


```{r}
# Data cleaning (Separate date into year and month)
HouseSales$year_sold <- as.integer(substring(HouseSales$date, 1, 4))
HouseSales$month_sold <- as.integer(substring(HouseSales$date, 5, 6))
HouseSales$date <-NULL
# Data cleaning (price to numeric)
HouseSales$price<-parse_number(HouseSales$price)
```


```{r}
cor_matrix = round(cor(HouseSales), 3)
cor_matrix
```
```{r}
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "circle")
```


\newpage
## III. Model Development Process (15 points)

*Build a regression model to predict price.  And of course,  create the train data set which contains 70% of the data and use set.seed (1023). The remaining 30% will be your test data set. Investigate the data and combine the level of categorical variables if needed and drop variables. For example, you can drop id, Latitude, Longitude, etc. *

```{r section3a}
set.seed(1023)

response <- "price"

#Dropping variables as specified
drop.vars <- c("id", "lat", "long")
kc.house.df <- dplyr::select(HouseSales, -drop.vars) 

#Renaming to conform to unified convention
kc.house.df <- kc.house.df %>% rename("year_built" = "yr_built")
```

```{r section3b}
#Feature Ideas
#Quality Adjusted Features
transform_sqft_adj_grade <- function(kc.house.df){
  
  sqft_adj_grade <- kc.house.df[, "sqft_living"] / kc.house.df[, "grade"]
  
  return (sqft_adj_grade)
}

transform_sqft_adj_condition <- function(kc.house.df){
  
  sqft_adj_condition <- kc.house.df[, "sqft_living"] / kc.house.df[, "condition"]
  
  return (sqft_adj_condition)
}

transform_sqft_adj_waterfront <- function(kc.house.df){
  
  sqft_adj_waterfront <- kc.house.df[, "sqft_living"] * kc.house.df[, "waterfront"]
  
  return (sqft_adj_waterfront)
}

transform_poly_sqft_living <- function(kc.house.df){
  #Center variables for polynomial terms
  sqft_living <- (kc.house.df$sqft_living - mean(kc.house.df$sqft_living)) 
  sqft_living_squared <- sqft_living^2
  
  return (list(center = sqft_living, squared = sqft_living_squared))
}

transform_poly_floor <- function(kc.house.df){
  floors <- (kc.house.df$floors - mean(kc.house.df$floors)) 
  floors_squared <- floors^2
  
  return(list(center = floors, squared = floors_squared))
}
```

Centering the variables do not change the interpretation of the coefficients. However they do change the interpretation of the intercept. Instead of the intercept being read as the value of price when all variables are zero. It is not read as price when all variables are zero, `floors` is equal to its average and `sqft_living` is equal to its average.

```{r section3c}
#Apply transformations 

kc.house.df$sqft_adj_grade <- transform_sqft_adj_grade(kc.house.df)
kc.house.df$sqft_adj_condition <- transform_sqft_adj_condition(kc.house.df)
kc.house.df$sqft_adj_waterfront <- transform_sqft_adj_waterfront(kc.house.df)

res <- transform_poly_sqft_living(kc.house.df)
kc.house.df$sqft_living <- res$center
kc.house.df$sqft_living_squared <- res$squared

res <- transform_poly_floor(kc.house.df)
kc.house.df$floors <- res$center
kc.house.df$floors_squared <- res$squared

#Remove collinear variables
# sqft_basement + sqft_above = sqft_living
kc.house.df$sqft_basement <- NULL
```

```{r section3d}
set.seed(1023)

#use 70% of dataset as training set and 30% as test set
train_prop <- 0.7

index <- sample(1:nrow(HouseSales), size = round(train_prop * nrow(kc.house.df)))
kc.house.train.X <- kc.house.df[index, -which(names(kc.house.df) %in% c(response))] # modified slightly 
kc.house.train.y <- kc.house.df [index, response]

kc.house.test.X <- kc.house.df [-index, -which(names(kc.house.df) %in% c(response))]
kc.house.test.y <- kc.house.df [-index, response]
```

```{r}
#baseline model
baseline.model <- lm(price ~ ., data = cbind(price = kc.house.train.y, kc.house.train.X))
summary(baseline.model)
```


\newpage
## IV. Model Performance Testing (15 points)

*Use the test data set to assess the model performances. Here, build the best multiple linear models by using the stepwise both ways selection method. Compare the performance of the best two linear models. Make sure that model assumption(s) are checked for the final linear model. Apply remedy measures (transformation, etc.) that helps satisfy the assumptions. In particular you must deeply investigate unequal variances and multicollinearity. If necessary, apply remedial methods (WLS, Ridge, Elastic Net, Lasso, etc.). *

#TODO
1. Stepwise feature selection
2. Add plots (e.g. scale location, residual vs fitted)
3. Normality plots

TODO: The following code needs to be updated once we have the updated models from stepwise feature selection.
```{r}
#evaluate on test data

CalcTestMetrics <- function(pred, act, n, p) {
  SST <- var(act)*(length(act)-1)
  SSE <- sum((act-pred)^2)
  SSR <- sum(pred - mean(act))^2
  rsquared <- 1- SSE/SST
  
  adj.rsquared <- 1 - (((1 - rsquared)*(n-1)) / (n-p-1))
  mse <- sum((act - pred)^2) / (n-p)
  mae <- (sum(abs(act-pred))) / n
  
  return (
    list(
      adj.rsquared = adj.rsquared,
      rsquared = rsquared,
      mse = mse,
      mae = mae
    )
  )
}

pred <- predict(baseline.model, kc.house.test.X)
act <- kc.house.test.y
n <- dim(model.matrix(baseline.model)[, -1])[1]
p <- dim(model.matrix(baseline.model)[, -1])[2]

cbind(CalcTestMetrics(pred, act, n, p))
```


\newpage
## V. Challenger Models (15 points)

*Build an alternative model based on one of the following approaches to predict price: regression tree, NN, or SVM. Explore using a logistic regression. Check the applicable model assumptions. Apply in-sample and out-of-sample testing, backtesting and review the comparative goodness of fit of the candidate models. Describe step by step your procedure to get to the best model and why you believe it is fit for purpose.*

## VI. Model Limitation and Assumptions (15 points)

*Based on the performances on both train and test data sets, determine your primary (champion) model and the other model which would be your benchmark model. Validate your models using the test sample. Do the residuals look normal? Does it matter given your technique? How is the prediction performance using Pseudo R^2, SSE, RMSE?  Benchmark the model against alternatives. How good is the relative fit? Are there any serious violations of the model assumptions? Has the model had issues or limitations that the user must know? (Which assumptions are needed to support the Champion model?)* 


\newpage
## VII. Ongoing Model Monitoring Plan (5 points)

*How would you picture the model needing to be monitored, which quantitative thresholds and triggers would you set to decide when the model needs to be replaced? What are the assumptions that the model must comply with for its continuous use?*

### Overview

For model monitoring there are four areas to track 1) model stability, 2) prediction performance, 3) incremental data quality and 4) data pipeline failures. 

### 1. Prediction Stability

This subsection concerns itself with stability of predictions. Price predictions often are used by loan originators to size a loan or as an input to a consumer product. For example, assume the product is a home price recommendation for homeowners looking to see. If the homeowners aka the customers get highly variable sale price recommendations month to month, it'll result in subpar user experience, creating distrust between the customer and the firm. 

To check for prediction stability the approach is to store last month's prediction values in a database table and the model itself in an S3 bucket as an RDS file. We are assuming new data arrives in monthly batches because that is the frequency of our data set.

```{r section7helperfunction}
adjust_months <- function(date, num_months) {
  # Convert to character for easier manipulation
  date_str <- as.character(date)
  
  # Extract year and month components
  year <- substr(date_str, 1, 4)
  month <- substr(date_str, 5, 6)
  
  # Convert to numeric and adjust months
  result_month <- as.numeric(month) + num_months
  result_year <- as.numeric(year) + floor((result_month - 1) / 12)
  result_month <- (result_month - 1) %% 12 + 1  # Ensure the month is within 1 to 12
  
  # Create the result as "yyyymm"
  result <- paste0(result_year, sprintf("%02d", result_month))
  
  return(result)
}
```

Since we do not have infrastructure stood up we use the following code block to simulate pulling in previous month's model and corresponding predictions. We sample the data using a sliding window approach. The past 12 months of data are used to train the model and the subsequent month is the test set. This different from the world in previous parts because here we are simulating the arrival of new data.

```{r section7previousmodel}
concat_date <- kc.house.df$year_sold*100 + kc.house.df$month_sold
kc.house.df$yyyymm <- concat_date

set.seed(1023)

lookback.window <- 12 #one year lookback window
#Any data before this date is in the training set
#Any data after is in the test set
cutoff_date <- 201501
train_start <- adjust_months(cutoff_date, -lookback.window)

prev_train_data <- kc.house.df[
  which(
    kc.house.df$yyyymm < cutoff_date &
    kc.house.df$yyyymm >= train_start
  ), 
]

#horizon is the size of the test set
#Here one means the subsequent month, so 201501
#If it was 2 then the test set will include [201501-201502] so forth
horizon <- 1
test_start <- cutoff_date
test_end <- adjust_months(test_start, horizon)

prev_test_data <- kc.house.df[
  which(
    (kc.house.df$yyyymm < test_end) &
    (kc.house.df$yyyymm >= test_start) 
  ), 
]

previous.model <- lm(price ~ . -year_sold -month_sold - yyyymm, data = prev_train_data)
previous.pred <- predict(previous.model, prev_test_data)
```

Now we simulate getting a new batch of data and fitting the model on new data. We compare the new model predictions against the old model using 

1. T-test on the means of the predictions
  
  - To determine if prediction means are drifting from month to month

2. F-test for the variance of the predictions

  - To determine if prediction variance is drifiting from month to month

3. T-test on the mean squared error. 

  - To determine if mean squared error is drifting from month to month

For assumption checking, we use Anderson-Darling test to check normality of predictions. Shapiro-Wilk test will not work due to the large sample size.

In practice, model stability tests tend to be overly sensitive so we will trigger Slack warnings when the p-values of the test are less than 0.01. 

```{r}
library(nortest)

#Current Model
cutoff_date <- adjust_months(cutoff_date, 1)
train_start <- adjust_months(cutoff_date, -lookback.window)

curr_train_data <- kc.house.df[
  which(
    kc.house.df$yyyymm < cutoff_date &
    kc.house.df$yyyymm >= train_start
  ), 
]

horizon <- 1
test_start <- cutoff_date
test_end <- adjust_months(test_start, horizon)

curr_test_data <- kc.house.df[
  which(
    (kc.house.df$yyyymm < test_end) &
    (kc.house.df$yyyymm >= test_start) 
    
  ), 
]
current.model <- lm(price ~ . -year_sold -month_sold, data = curr_train_data)
curr.pred <- predict(current.model, curr_test_data)

# H0: same means
# H1: means are not the same
t.test(previous.pred, curr.pred)

# H0: same variance
# H1: variance are not the same
var.test(previous.pred, curr.pred)

#Check if mean squared error is equivalent
prev_sq_error <- (prev_test_data[, "price"] - previous.pred)^2
curr_sq_error <- (curr_test_data[, "price"] - curr.pred)^2
t.test(prev_sq_error, curr_sq_error)

#Check predictions are normal
ad.test(current.model$residuals)
```

Looks like in our case, the tests will trigger and warn us that the mean predictions have deviated (increased), variances have not, MSE has not and the AD test will trigger an assumption violation alert. Means of predictions deviating doesn't warrant much of a concern but still worth notifying to ensure consumers and downstream stakeholders can be informed about the current month's prediction. 

The most important of these is MSE as we do not want our model to fluctuate in terms of error. We certainly do not want MSE to deviate downwards to significant degree (alert can adjusted to trigger when difference is negative and significant). Normality is important for inference in the case that model coefficients become part of a product. However it is not as important currently since we are only concerned with predictive power.

### 2. Prediction Performance over Time

For this section we track model metrics over time to ensure the model continues to be on par. Metrics we choose are adjusted $R^2$ and RMSE. We apply a function to create a rolling window for the model to train on and then test with data outside the window. We collect the metrics and plot them over time. 

If any metrics fall below the baseline production model, we will trigger a slack message.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#Iterate over folds
roll_model <- function(cutoff_date, form){
  
  lookback.window <- 6 #six month lookback
  train_start <- adjust_months(cutoff_date, -lookback.window)
  
  train_data <- kc.house.df[
    which(
      kc.house.df$yyyymm < cutoff_date &
      kc.house.df$yyyymm >= train_start
    ), 
  ]
  
  horizon <- 1
  test_start <- cutoff_date
  test_end <- adjust_months(test_start, horizon)
  
  test_data <- kc.house.df[
    which(
      (kc.house.df$yyyymm < test_end) &
      (kc.house.df$yyyymm >= test_start) 
      
    ), 
  ]
  model <- lm(form, data = train_data)
  pred <- predict(model, test_data)
  
  act <- test_data[, "price"]
  n <- dim(model.matrix(model))[1]
  p <- dim(model.matrix(model))[2]
  
  metric <- CalcTestMetrics(pred, act, n, p)

  return (metric)
}

The `Adjusted R Squared over Months` plot will have no triggers. On the contrary, `RMSE over Months` will trigger on 2014-09, 2014-11, and 2014-12. 

### 3. Incremental Data Quality Check

When new data comes in at monthly interval we will perform checks to prevent malformed data from entering the model. First we create graphs to add to a dashboard for visual inspection. These are the `Residuals vs Leverage` plot to detect outliers, leverage points or both and the `Cook's Distance` chart to detect influential points. The hope is to catch problematic points early, before they reach the model.

```{r}
library(olsrr)
incremental_data <- curr_test_data
incremental.model <- lm(price ~ . -year_sold -month_sold, data = incremental_data)

#Residual vs Leverage
ols_plot_resid_lev(incremental.model)
#Cook's Distance Visualized
ols_plot_cooksd_chart(incremental.model)
```

To compare the old data with the new incremental data batch we perform a Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test for continuous features and Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test for categorical data. The threshold we set will be a conservative 0.01 because these tests tend to be overly sensitive due to the variable nature of real data.

```{r}
old_data <- curr_train_data

continuous_features <- c(
  "price", 
  "sqft_living", 
  "sqft_lot", 
  "sqft_above", 
  "year_built", 
  "yr_renovated", 
  "sqft_living15", 
  "sqft_lot15"
)
discrete_features <- c(
  "bedrooms", 
  "bathrooms", 
  "floors", 
  "waterfront", 
  "view", 
  "condition", 
  "grade", 
  "zipcode"
)

ks_pvalues <- c()
for (feature in continuous_features){
  pval <- ks.test(
    old_data[, feature], 
    incremental_data[, feature], 
    simulate.p.value = TRUE
  )$p.value
  
  ks_pvalues <- c(ks_pvalues, pval)
}

chisq_pvalues <- c()
for (feature in discrete_features){
  # Extract the column data
  old_feature_data <- old_data[[feature]]
  n <- length(old_feature_data)
  expected_probabilities <- table(old_feature_data) / n 
  
  incremental_feature_data <- incremental_data[[feature]]
  n <- length(incremental_feature_data)
  observed_probabilities <- table(old_feature_data) / n
  
  #want to compare new to old
  pval <- chisq.test(
    observed_probabilities, 
    expected_probabilities, 
    simulate.p.value = TRUE
  )$p.value
  
  chisq_pvalues <- c(chisq_pvalues, pval)
}

cbind(continuous_features, ks_pvalues)
cbind(discrete_features, chisq_pvalues)
```

Looks like `price`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms` and `zipcode` deviated in our incremental data batch.

### 4. Pipeline Fail Safes

*Note: No examples are shown here because we do not have data infrastructure*

The plan to handle pipeline failures is to persist every production model and every test and training set of data. It is ok to store large amounts of data because storage is cheap in the modern day. Models RDS files will be stored in an S3 bucket. The data sets will be stored as compressed parquet files because production database tables usually only contain the most updated version (upserted records) and in this case we want to revert to data before any updates were made. When the pipeline fails, we can use old data and the old model to continue to generate predictions. This ensures downstream stakeholders are free from breaking changes and free from work disruption.
